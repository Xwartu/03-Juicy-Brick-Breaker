# 03-Juicy-Brick-Breaker
C220 Brick Breaker clone project that we are trying to make juicy.

Requirements: 2 Levels - 560 score for first threshold, 1120 score to win.

Score and lives are tracked, lives are lost by going off screen below the paddle. Start with 8 lives. Control paddle with mouse.

Something I'm not sure about is that my main menu isn't an in-game menu, but I intrepreteted that instruction as a start screen. There is also win and lose screens with full functionality.

Documentation of Juice: Soundtrack, Sound effects, Particles for Paddle, Particles for Walls, Particles for Brick, Ball Trail, Blocks fall off when they are hit, Color changing background, constant particle effect on ball, paddle stretches when moving fast, Colors for everything and colors change between levels (besides the Ball)

# Implementation
Thanks to kenney.nl (www.kenney.nl) for fonts, icons, and I grabbed a random assortment of assets from different packs for particles, all directly from Kenny.nl.
